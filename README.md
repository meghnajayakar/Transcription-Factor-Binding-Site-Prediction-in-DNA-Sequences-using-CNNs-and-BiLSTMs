Identification of Transcription Factor Binding Sites in DNA Sequences. 
DNA sequences consist of a series of nucleotide bases: Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, Cytosine. The arrangement of these bases along the sequnce provides crucial sequential information. 
The ain of this project is to evaluate the ability of Recurrent Neural Networks in capturing these sequential dependencies and predicting TFBSs. 

The model architecture uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory.
